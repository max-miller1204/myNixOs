name: spec
description: "Use this skill when the user wants to spec out, plan, or design a feature, project, or task. Triggers on: 'spec', 'write a spec', 'plan this', 'design this', 'let me describe what I want', or when the user provides a file/description and wants a detailed specification written. Takes an optional $1 argument pointing to a file to read first."

Read $1 and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything:
- Technical implementation
- UI & UX
- Concerns
- Tradeoffs, etc.

But make sure the questions are not obvious. Challenge my assumptions - ask questions that might change the entire approach, not just refine it.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file.

After writing the spec, suggest an implementation approach (sequential vs parallel agents, worktree isolation, etc.) based on the scope.
